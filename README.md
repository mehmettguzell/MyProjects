[Query Optimization Project](https://github.com/mehmettguzell/MyProjects/tree/main/Query_Optimization)
- Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in performance tuning by applying indexing strategies without modifying the query or schema.
- The goal was to reduce SQL query execution times on the AdventureWorks2012 database by using filtered, composite, and covering indexes.
