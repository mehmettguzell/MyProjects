[LGS Tracking System](https://github.com/mehmettguzell/MyProjects/tree/main/LGS_Tracking_System)
- This desktop application enables effective tracking of students' exam performances and centralized management of student and exam data by administrators through a layered architecture.
- Designing and developing this project from scratch using a layered architecture approach has been an extremely educational experience for me. I never anticipated that I could grow so much by working on a single project in such depth. Throughout the process, I had the opportunity to learn and apply fundamental software development principles such as SOLID principles, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), Separation of Concerns, and Dependency Injection. I am aware of my mistakes and shortcomings; however, compared to my previous projects, I consider this to be my best work so far. Based on the experience I gained, I am confident that my future projects will be of higher quality, more maintainable, and sustainable.

[Sports Tracking System](https://github.com/mehmettguzell/MyProjects/tree/main/Sports_Tracking_Web_App)
- Purpose: To develop a web-based system for sports schools to manage student registrations, payments, athlete progress, and financial reports efficiently.
- Key Contributions and Learnings: This project advanced my expertise in full-stack web development using C# and ASP.NET, enabling me to build dynamic, secure applications. I gained hands-on experience in designing relational databases with SQL Server, crafting complex SQL queries, and implementing secure authentication with salting and hashing techniques.

[Query Optimization Project](https://github.com/mehmettguzell/MyProjects/tree/main/Query_Optimization)
- Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in performance tuning by applying indexing strategies without modifying the query or schema.
- The goal was to reduce SQL query execution times on the AdventureWorks2012 database by using filtered, composite, and covering indexes.

[Database Isolation Simulation](https://github.com/mehmettguzell/MyProjects/tree/main/Database_Isolation_Level) 
- Purpose: To analyze the effects of database transaction isolation levels and index usage on performance.

[Graduate Thesis System](https://github.com/mehmettguzell/MyProjects/tree/main/Graduate_Thesis_System) 
- Thanks to this project, I took the practice of designing database architecture, writing effective SQL queries and integrating a user -friendly interface with a solid backend structure.
- The aim of the system is to manage the master's and doctoral theses on a central platform, question and provide flexible filtering by maintaining data integrity.
